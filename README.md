# Mass Ordinaries

This repository contains Mass Ordinaries (the 16 standard masses and the 7 standard tones for the credo) for the Roman Rite.

Initially they were downloaded from [gregobase](https://gregobase.selapa.net).  They are intended for use with a [copier template](https://github.com/2e0byo/RomanRiteTemplate).
